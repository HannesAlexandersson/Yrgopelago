# stars
atm its a 4 star hotel, (I think)
-We have graphical presentation of book avability in the calender. 1 star
-we give discount, 10% each day over 3 days. 2 stars
-we have 3 features. 3 stars
-we have an adminpage where the manager can change the pricing of the rooms and features. 4 stars
-the last star I dont understand what it means,"have ability to use external data when producing a succeful booking response."
# Instructions
No instructions needed. The Hotel operates online. No installation needed. You only get your transfercode from the centralbank for the right amount and then use it to book your room. You can see in the calender if an certain room is already booked on a certain date. So dont try and doublebook becouse it is not possbile anyways. 
# Database
I use a sqlite database. Its simple but gets the job done. For more specific information about the db structure you can check out the database folder where I keep the db config file. It handles the information about the rooms and the features along with the pricing of those. That gives me the oppurtonity to via the admin page change the values in the db. And becouse I fetch the information about the rooms and features from the db in the html code it means that if I change the price from the admin the page the website automatic changes the price on the website and all the calculations also. Because they are all based of the value in the db.
