the vacation db is only a small simple db that takes the content from the loggbok and saves it under each and one of the
sub "titles" from the each booking-response. So for example "total_cost" have an own column, and "island_name" aswell.

The features have an own table. I thought that would be easiest for when to calculate how many distinct features I have booked.

SQLITE querys:

```
CREATE TABLE loggbok (logg_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
island_name VARCHAR,
hotel_name VARCHAR,
arrival_date date,
departure_date date,
total_cost int,
stars int
);

CREATE TABLE features (feat_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
feat_name VARCHAR,
logg_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (logg_id) REFERENCES loggbok(logg_id)
);

```
